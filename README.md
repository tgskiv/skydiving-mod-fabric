# Paragliding/Skydiving Mod for Minecraft based on Fabric

<img align="left" alt="Mod logo" width="128" height="128" src="src/main/resources/assets/skydivingmod/icon.png">

A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds realistic **wind physics** affecting Elytra gliding.

Being a skydiver myself, I noticed similarities between gliding with Elytras
and skydiving with small canopies. I immediately decided to share the experience
with friends.

Later, this mod was born as a simple toy to make Elytra flying a bit more fun.


## ✨ Features

- **Realistic flight physics**: Headwind slows you, tailwind boosts, crosswind drifts.
- **Dynamic Wind Direction and Speed**: Wind rotates gradually (15° per change - can be set in the settings).
- **Forecast System**: Maintains a forecast of 5 future wind changes (see Settings).
- **Wind Sync**: Server-controlled wind synced to all clients.
- **Console Commands**: See section below
- **Faster falling when twisting fast**: By default, with elytra, you can twist around the same place and continue descending safely enough. In real skydiving, if you twist rapidly, you lose speed, thus losing handleability and falling dangerously fast.
- **Wind cone**: You can either craft it (see section below), or use the command /give @p skydivingmod:windsock
- **Low altitude wind influence**:
  Wind strength will vary depending on your altitude above the terrain — lower altitudes will have less wind effect.
  - 0-5 blocks - 30% effect
  - 5-10 blocks - 50% effect
  - 10+ blocks - 100% effect
- **Settings**. Settings page with a persistent state
- **Updrift and Downwash**

  Air currents will push the player up or down based on vertical airflows, simulating thermals and sink zones.
  - Raise when Players are above slopes or ridges which facing the wind.
  - Falling when Players are above slopes or ridges against the wind.

  Effects are most strong when 20 blocks above the highest point in 5 block radius and gradually lose strength above and beyond this range


## 🧪 Upcoming Features

Your help would be appreciated! 💖

1. **Biome-Aware Wind**

   Different biomes will influence wind direction and intensity (e.g., deserts may have stronger gusts, forests more turbulence).
   Raise during the daytime:
   - Bare soil, dry grasslands, or any type of stone blocks slopes heat up quickly under the sun.

2. ~~**Weather-Driven Dynamics**~~

   ~~Rain, storms, and other weather conditions will dynamically alter wind behavior.~~

3. **Summon airplane** command

   It would be amazing to either cast a spell or use some radio to appear on the play flying high above.
