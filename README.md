# Skydiving Mod for Minecraft based on Fabric

A Minecraft Fabric mod that adds realistic **wind physics** affecting only Elytra gliding.

Being a skydiver myself, I noticed similarities between gliding with Elytras
and skydiving with small canopies. I immediately decided to share the experience
with friends.

Later, this mod was born as a simple toy to make Elytra flying a bit more fun.


## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Wind Direction**: Wind rotates gradually (15° per minute).
- **Variable Wind Speed**: Changes by ±0.002 every 60 seconds (clamped between 0.0–0.02).
- **Forecast System**: Maintains a queue of 15 future wind changes.
- **Wind Sync**: Server-controlled wind synced to all clients.
- **Command `/wind forecast`**: Shows next 5 wind changes in readable format (e.g., `2 min: SE at 0.015`).
- **Realistic flight physics**: Headwind slows you, tailwind boosts, crosswind drifts.
- **Disables wind when player is in water**.


## 🧪 Upcoming Features

Your help would be appreciated! 💖

- **Altitude-Based Wind Influence**

  Wind strength will vary depending on your altitude above the terrain — lower altitudes will have less wind effect.

- **Biome-Aware Wind**

  Different biomes will influence wind direction and intensity (e.g., deserts may have stronger gusts, forests more turbulence).

- **Weather-Driven Dynamics**
  
  Rain, storms, and other weather conditions will dynamically alter wind behavior.

- **Thermal Columns & Downwash**

  Air currents will push the player up or down based on vertical airflows, simulating thermals and sink zones.

- **Wind Sock Blocks 🏳**

  Craftable visual indicators to show current wind direction and speed in-world.
